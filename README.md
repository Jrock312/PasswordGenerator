Password Generator
I always tend to create one password then try and vary it when needed to update.  After a few times most site make it so you cant use the 
past few used passwords and then I cant remember what  i did.  I might as well just create a string of characters that i can just pull up
and this application will allow you to do that.

You can create a unique password with containing and upper and lowercase as well and numbers and special characters.
